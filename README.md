## further improvement

* Move to use NextJS (better routing)
* Move to use graphql to allow faster collection of data
* Using React Directive (but this is third party package, and may not be maintained. React does not have built in directive. Vue will be better :smiley: )
* Convert to TypeScript (Sorry no time yet)
